# Stock-Market-Prediction
Stock market prediction is a complex field, but here are some specific steps you could take to build a machine learning model for predicting stock prices:

Collect Data: Collect historical stock price data for the stocks you want to predict. You can use free sources like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance to get the data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean the data and preprocess it so that it's ready for analysis. This might include handling missing values, scaling the data, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data that might be useful for predicting stock prices. For example, you might calculate technical indicators like moving averages or relative strength index (RSI).

Choose Machine Learning Algorithm: Choose a machine learning algorithm that is appropriate for your data and the problem you're trying to solve. Common algorithms for stock market prediction include regression models like linear regression or support vector regression, as well as neural networks like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.

Train and Evaluate Model: Train the machine learning model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. You can use metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

Make Predictions: Once you have a trained and evaluated model, you can use it to make predictions on new data. You can build a user interface using Django where users can input a stock symbol and view the predicted stock price.

Note that stock market prediction is a difficult problem and it's unlikely that any model will be able to predict prices with perfect accuracy. However, with careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, and algorithm selection, you can build a model that provides useful predictions for investors.
